# This project examines the life expectancy of various countries of the world. It seeks to predict the life expectancy(dependent variable) using twenty features(independent variables). After series of data wrangling and cleaning, the dataset was splitted to train set, valididty set and then test set using random forest regressor for feature selection and importance. The models LinearRegression, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net were fitted using dependent validity set and independent validity set(X_val, y_val) since we have less than one hundred thousand samples and few features are important.Needful to say that google colaboratory was used. Want to know the model that fit the most? then, view the project
